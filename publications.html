Capacity drop, a traffic phenomenon indicating that the discharge flow from a queue is lower than the pre-queue flow, is commonly observed at freeway bottlenecks. In the literature, the majority of empirical studies on capacity drop rely on aggregated traffic flow data. To fully understand the mechanism behind capacity drop, it is essential to analyze trajectory data, which captures the microscopic behavior of individual vehicles. However, the availability of high-quality trajectory data covering both sufficient spatial and temporal scope is limited. Consequently, existing theories and mechanisms to explain capacity drop from the perspective of vehicle behavior are predominantly analytical, lacking direct evidence to validate their impacts on contributing to capacity drop. This paper fills this gap by conducting a comprehensive empirical analysis of capacity drop using high-resolution trajectory data extracted from videos recorded by unmanned aerial vehicles. The empirical analysis examines the relative effects of various capacity drop mechanisms and reveals the following findings: (i) The late responses of hesitant vehicles during the acceleration process significantly contribute to capacity drop; (ii) the impact of response delay on queue discharge rate is more pronounced at lower congestion speeds; (iii) response delays primarily result from deceleration during car-following, followed by lane changes, with their combined effect having a more pronounced triggering impact. These findings are subsequently validated using data collected from another site. The findings presented in this paper are valuable for developing more accurate microscopic traffic simulation models and designing more effective traffic management and control strategies.

This paper introduces an innovative approach to model the lane-change (LC) process of vehicles by employing parallel learning, seamlessly integrating conventional physical or behavioral models with data-driven counterparts. The LC process is divided into two distinct steps: the LC decision and the LC implementation, each independently modeled. For the LC decision model, a utility-based model is embedded into a neural network. Simultaneously, the LC implementation model incorporates a conventional car-following model, replicating the behavior of the new follower of the lane-changer, within the training process of a long-short-term memory model. Empirical trajectory data collected from unmanned aerial vehicles, which provides detailed information on the vehicles’ lane-changing process, serves as the basis for training and testing the proposed models. Additionally, data from a different site is employed to assess model transferability. Results demonstrate that the proposed models adeptly predict both LC decisions and implementations, outperforming baseline physical and behavioral models, as well as pure data-driven models, in terms of prediction accuracy and transferability. These findings highlight the significant potential of these models in improving the precision of microscopic traffic simulators.

Vehicle trajectory data is essential for analyzing and modeling complex traffic behaviors. Although extraction of vehicle trajectory from aerial video data is not a new problem, obtaining trajectories with heading information across various road types requires further research. In this paper, we propose OpenVTER, a generalized open-source framework based on rotated bounding boxes.
