            Capacity drop, a traffic phenomenon indicating that the discharge flow from a queue is lower than the pre-queue flow, is commonly observed at freeway bottlenecks. In the literature, the majority of empirical studies on capacity drop rely on aggregated traffic flow data. To fully understand the mechanism behind capacity drop, it is essential to analyze trajectory data, which captures the microscopic behavior of individual vehicles. However, the availability of high-quality trajectory data covering both sufficient spatial and temporal scope is limited. Consequently, existing theories and mechanisms to explain capacity drop from the perspective of vehicle behavior are predominantly analytical, lacking direct evidence to validate their impacts on contributing to capacity drop. This paper fills this gap by conducting a comprehensive empirical analysis of capacity drop using high-resolution trajectory data extracted from videos recorded by unmanned aerial vehicles. The empirical analysis examines the relative effects of various capacity drop mechanisms and reveals the following findings: (i) The late responses of hesitant vehicles during the acceleration process significantly contribute to capacity drop; (ii) the impact of response delay on queue discharge rate is more pronounced at lower congestion speeds; (iii) response delays primarily result from deceleration during car-following, followed by lane changes, with their combined effect having a more pronounced triggering impact. These findings are subsequently validated using data collected from another site. The findings presented in this paper are valuable for developing more accurate microscopic traffic simulation models and designing more effective traffic management and control strategies.

            Vehicle trajectory data is essential for analyzing and modeling complex traffic behaviors. Although extraction of vehicle trajectory from aerial video data is not a new problem, obtaining trajectories with heading information across various road types, such as intersections or long road segments, requires further research. In this paper, we propose OpenVTER, a generalized Open-source Vehicle Trajectory Extraction framework based on Rotated bounding boxes (RBBs). This framework includes several key components: video stabilization, image division, vehicle detection, vehicle tracking, and data post-processing. Specifically, the rotated vehicle detection model, named YOLOX-R, is applied to detect the small and rotated vehicles using RBBs that provide vehicle heading information. A base-frame video stabilization method is proposed to reduce error accumulation in the transformation matrix and improve the computational efficiency. The rotated vehicle tracking model, named SORT-R, is proposed to enable real-time tracking of RBBs. The performance of YOLOX-R is evaluated on two datasets, showing that vehicle detection challenges are well addressed. Ablation experiments were also conducted to analyze the effectiveness of different modules. Subsequently, we evaluate the completeness of the extracted trajectories under various road types and lighting conditions. The extracted trajectories are also compared with the NGSIM dataset, focusing on internal and platoon consistency. These evaluations demonstrate both the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed framework. Additionally, the visualization analyses of different road types demonstrate the advantages of the trajectories extracted by OpenVTER in various road scenarios for traffic research. The code and dataset are available online for non-commercial research purposes.
