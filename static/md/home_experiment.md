The data collection experiment was conducted on a road network in Nanjing, China, during the morning peak hours on two sunny workdays, June 16 and 17, 2022, following a trial run on June 15. 

**Location**  
The site covers a 4.5 km stretch of the urban ring road (the Hurong Expressway) and part of its connected urban network.

**Traffic Conditions**  
In the left-to-right direction, two active bottlenecks typically occur. One is located at a merge section where traffic enters from an urban arterial, Shiyang Road, and the other occurs at the merge with another freeway at the Gaoqiaomen Interchange. In the right-to-left direction, a single active bottleneck is usually observed, originating from the merge section at the Gaoqiaomen Interchange.

**Time Period**  
Each day’s experiment began at 7:00 am and ended around 9:00 am.

**Method**  
16 drones with overlapping views to capture continuous vehicle trajectories. 16 experienced pilots were organized into five groups, coordinating battery replacements to maximize continuous recording time.

**Data Quality**  
4K aerial videos collected using DJI Air 2S drones for high-resolution trajectory extraction.
