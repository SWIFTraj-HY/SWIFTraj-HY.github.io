**Location**  
The site covers a 4.5 km stretch of the urban ring road (the Hurong Expressway) and part of its connected urban network.

**Time Period**  
Each day’s experiment began at 7:00 am and ended around 9:00 am.

**Traffic Conditions**  
There are multiple active bottlenecks on the 4-lane freeway stretch, including merge and weaving sections.

**Recording**  
16 experienced pilots, divided into five groups (A–E), operated the drones. Overlapping fields of view between neighboring drones ensured that trajectories from consecutive images could be connected into continuous vehicle trajectories.

**Data Quality**  
4K aerial videos collected using DJI Air 2S drones for high-resolution trajectory extraction.
