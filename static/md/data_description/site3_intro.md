### Site Description

The study site covers a 1 km stretch of the Yingtian Urban Freeway in Nanjing. Data were collected during the morning peak hour (7:00–8:00) on four sunny weekdays.

In the left-to-right direction, an active bottleneck typically occurs at a diverge section spanning from 150 to 300 m, where traffic enters the freeway. In the opposite (right-to-left) direction, a single active bottleneck spanning from 400 to 850 m is observed. This bottleneck leads to traffic breakdown and the formation of shockwaves, resulting in increased congestion in the upstream section of the merge area, located approximately 750 m from the site’s origin.
