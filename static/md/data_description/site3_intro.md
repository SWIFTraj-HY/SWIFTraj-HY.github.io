### Site3 Description

The site covers a 4.5 km stretch of the urban ring road (the Hurong Freeway) and part of its connected urban network.
 
Traffic on the freeway is two-directional. In the left-to-right direction, two active bottlenecks typically occur during the morning peak hours. One is located at a merge section where traffic enters from an urban arterial, Shiyang Road, and the other occurs at the merge with another freeway at the Gaoqiaomen Interchange. In the opposite (right-to-left) direction, a single active bottleneck is usually observed, originating from the merge section at the Gaoqiaomen Interchange.
