This is another urban expressway site where we collected UAV-based trajectory data for traffic analysis. The study site covers a 1 km stretch of the Yingtian Urban Expressway in Nanjing. Data were collected during the morning peak hour (7:00–8:00) on four sunny weekdays using two UAVs. The trajectories extracted from the two UAV videos were stitched to obtain continuous vehicle movements. In both directions, an active bottleneck occurred at the weaving section, and congestion intensified upstream of the merge point due to overloaded traffic demand.
